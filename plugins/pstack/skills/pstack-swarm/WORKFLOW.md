# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Select each worker’s exact execution identity through the owner’s model-selection policy. If a selected identity is unavailable, follow the host policy for fallback and report the identity actually used. For a race, name each arm up front. Match each delegate's effort to the job, per the Subagents section of the [pstack-poteto-mode](../pstack-poteto-mode/WORKFLOW.md) workflow.
4. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Launch the authorized workers through the available delegation API, within its concurrency limits. Use local execution by default. Remote execution needs explicit authorization and a verified remote capability. When delegation is unavailable or forbidden, cover slices sequentially yourself and label the result as a single-agent pass, not a multi-model race.

When a worker must start from a non-default pushed branch, pass the verified harness checkout/base-branch option.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with a result table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
